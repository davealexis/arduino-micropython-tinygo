# Comparing Arduino, MicroPython, CircuitPython, and TinyGo

This repo contains example projects that compare Arduino, MicroPython (and CircuitPython), and TinyGo.
The same logic is implemented in each environment/language, so you can see how they compare, and where
one language may offer slightly more capability than the other.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me on Twitter @davealexis or
